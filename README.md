# ðŸ‘‹ Passionate and outcome-driven UI / UX front & back-end website designer & developer
Over the past 8 years, I have worked alongside incredible designers and developer who have the same passion and dedication as I have. During the time, this has developed my own skills, solving complex problems with simplistic solutions for the web, building user experiences and scalable applications and understanding of planning strategies and clear business goals.
